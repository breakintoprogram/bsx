#### Z80 based homebrew computer
This project is a Z80 based computer designed to run on breadboards.
It is a work-in-progress, and the current specs are:
- 32K of ROM (EEPROM for ease of reprogramming)
- 32K of RAM
- A very basic machine code monitor in ROM
- Input and output via serial IO

The intention is to work towards a fully functioning MSX1 clone on a breadboard, with a TMS9918 video chip and AY-8912 sound
